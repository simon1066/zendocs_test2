Scoping
============

There are a number of issues that have to be addressed when scoping the code changes necessary.
1. Flagging which products should be considered Digital Goods as per EU rules
2. Determining correct tax rate to  use
3. Complying with the 'Two Location identifiers' rule
4. Allow shop to opt out of supplying EU countries for Digital Goods
5. Identify B2B or B2C customers
6. Reporting Quarterly relevant sales
