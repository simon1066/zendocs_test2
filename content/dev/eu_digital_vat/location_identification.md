Location Identification
============

Currently, the rules expect the store to collect 2 pieces of location information, although 3 may be needed if the the first 2 conflict.
e.g.

If the customer supplies their address, that is one piece of information. Location can also be determined by IP address (geoIp).
However if for some reason the geoIP returns a different country, then some 3rd method would be needed.
