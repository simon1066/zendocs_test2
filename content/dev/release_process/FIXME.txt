Docs: 
- updating Implementation guide - add to steps (perhaps post-release steps?)
- updating what's new and changed files docs


Process: 

- In 1.5.8, we stamped the alpha builds.  It is not clear whether this was the right decision; perhaps only final release builds should be stamped.  TBD.
If we change, update version_stamping.md
