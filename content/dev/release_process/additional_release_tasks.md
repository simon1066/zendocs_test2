Some final actions need to be done to wrap up the release.

- Update the **What's New** and **Changed Files** documents for the release in [zencart_documentation/content/release](https://docs.zen-cart.com/release/).

- Create a release announcement on the Zen Cart Forum.  Create it as a sticky post (click Administrative > Stick Thread).  Here is an [example release announcement](https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?229041-Zen-Cart-1-5-8-Released!).   You should also take the time here to unstick prior release announcements and updates as appropriate.

 <div style="text-align:right;" id="next">
   <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="/dev/release_process/ping_server/">
        Next - Ping Server<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2"></i>
    </a>
 </div>
