A plugin called [Extra Product Fields](https://github.com/torvista/Zen_Cart-Extra_Product_Fields)
has been developed that demonstrates the use of observers to add a field to the products table.  

As an alternative approach, you may wish to [create a child table](/dev/code/child_table_products/). 

Then you may need to [customize your template to display the new field](/dev/code/displaying_custom_fields/) if the field is intended to be shown on the storefront.
