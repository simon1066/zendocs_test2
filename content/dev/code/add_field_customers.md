A plugin called [Optional Payment Method](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1930)
has been developed that demonstrates how to add a field to the customers table. 

Then you may need to [customize your template to display the new field](/dev/code/displaying_custom_fields/) if the field is intended to be shown on the storefront.
