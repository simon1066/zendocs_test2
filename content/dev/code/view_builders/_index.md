These are a set of classes used to aid the rapid development of 
pages/views that display tabular data.

Initially they are meant to aid in the building of admin pages,
however some aspects will also be able to be used catalog side as well.

The structure of view builder classes and the data formats they use allow 
for much easier integration with plugins that need to add extra columns
or actions in admin pages.
