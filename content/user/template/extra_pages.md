Because many people want to add content to their store, Zen Cart comes with three built-in "extra" pages.  

These pages are [define pages](/user/template/define_pages/), which can be managed using the [Admin > Tools > Define Pages Editor](/user/admin_pages/tools/define_pages/). 

Page Name | File| URL 
----------|-----|-----
Page 2 |  `define_page_2.php` | `index.php?main_page=page_2`
Page 3 |  `define_page_3.php` | `index.php?main_page=page_3` 
Page 4 | `define_page_4.php` | `index.php?main_page=page_4`  

The Extra Pages are displayed in the [More Information sidebox](/user/sideboxes/more_information_sidebox/).

There are other ways to create new pages; see [Adding Pages](/user/customizing/add_pages/).
