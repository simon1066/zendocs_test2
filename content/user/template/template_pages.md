The most commonly modified files in a Zen Cart template are the files in `includes/templates/YOURTEMPLATE/templates`, which control how a page looks. 

These files are sometimes called "template files" but for clarity we'll call them template pages, to differentiate them from sidebox files, language files or any other part of a template. 

For example, the template page for the Featured Products page is `includes/templates/YOURTEMPLATE/templates/tpl_featured_products_default.php`.

Template pages will each be a certain [page type](/user/template/page_types/), depending on the page. For example, the featured products page is a listing page. 
There are separate FAQs for each of the [pages in the storefront](/user/storefront_pages/).  Take a look there to find more information about a specific page.
