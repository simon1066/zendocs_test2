By default, sent emails are not stored.  You may however turn on saving emails
using setting the [Email Archiving Active](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_email/#email_archiving_active) configuration value to *true*, and you may view stored emails using [Email Archive Manager](/user/email/email_archive_manager/). 

**NOTE:** This `email_archive` table, where emails are stored, grows large
quickly, so be sure to cull it frequently.
