The setting [`ROBOTS_PAGES_TO_SKIP`]() allows you to make pages use the `nofollow` parameter without needing extensive code changes.

In Zen Cart 1.5.8 and above, this setting is defined in `includes/extra_configures/robots_pages_to_skip.php`.  

In older versions, it is in `includes/languages/english/meta_tags.php`.
