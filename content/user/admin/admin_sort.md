Since Zen Cart 1.5.6, it has been possible to sort lists of products on the Categories/Products page at the products level. 

![Sorting products in Admin](/images/admin_product_sort.png) 

Use the _Categories/Product Display Order_ dropdown, and pick the field you would like to sort on.  Your product list will now be sorted by that field.  

**Note:** This only changes the view in the admin; on the storefront side, the sort order field will determine how  products are sorted.
