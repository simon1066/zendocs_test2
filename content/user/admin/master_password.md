There are many cases where it is beneficial to login to a customer's account. 

- Troubleshooting a problem they are experiencing
- Placing an order on their behalf 
- Pre-loading the cart for them to complete an order.

The [Login as Customer](/user/running/login_as_customer/) feature allows you to 
select a customer's account in Admin > Customers and login as them using your admin credentials
by clicking the "Place Order" button on the side box showing their account. 

Prior to this version, logging in as a customer was still possible using 
one of these plugins:
