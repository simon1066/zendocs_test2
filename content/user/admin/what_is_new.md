The setting [Admin > Configuration > Maximum Values > New Product Listing - Limited to ...](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_maximumvalues/) determines what "New Product" means: 

```
Limit the New Product Listing to
0= All Products
1= Current Month
7= 7 Days
14= 14 Days
30= 30 Days
60= 60 Days
90= 90 Days
120= 120 Days
```

Reducing this value means a more efficient query for generating a list of new products. 


ALTERNATIVE:
If, however, you wish to hand-pick which items show up, then turn OFF the *New Products* box, and use *Featured Products* instead.  See [Admin > Catalog > Featured Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/featured/) to pick the products.
