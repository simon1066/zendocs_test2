Sometimes you'll read about a plugin and want to try it yourself. 

Here's how to find it in the Plugins Library: 

- Go to Plugin Library
https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php

- click Advanced Search

- Enter the plugin name in the search box, and set the dropdown to Search Titles only.

This should find the plugin for you if it is in the Plugins Library. 

Another option is to use Google to search for a plugin.  

If you enter 

```
site:zen-cart.com name-of-plugin 
```

into the search box at Google.com, you will likely find what you want on the first page.
