The [Commercial Help Wanted](https://www.zen-cart.com/forumdisplay.php?138-Commercial-Help-Wanted) forum allows users who want to hire a web pro do so 
within the Zen Cart forum.  It's free to post jobs, but to see the posts,
developers have to pay a subscription fee, so it helps the project.

### HOW IT WORKS: 
People who have paid to subscribe in order to see all the posts in this area (so they can respond to your requests) will see your post when they next look at their unread forum posts. Then if they think you've given them enough information and they think that their skills are enough to provide what you're asking for, they will send you a [private message](/user/zen_cart_forum/pm/) - also called a PM - with an offer to help.

### IF YOU GET NO RESPONSE: 
It could be for many reasons, including possibly: not enough information to understand what you're needing, they don't think they know how to do it, they don't feel you would be willing to pay them appropriately, or maybe they just haven't logged in yet and haven't seen what you've posted.

### TIPS TO GET RESPONSES:
- give lots of relevant details, including version numbers of Zen Cart and PHP and MySQL and the plugins or templates you have installed, especially those related to whatever work you want done; don't make them ask for all the necessary information;
- indicate your budget, so they know whether your offer is attractive or worth their time;
- indicate your timeline so they can determine whether they are available to do the work in the timeframe you require it;

### I'M A DEVELOPER - HOW DO I JOIN? 
Use the [CHW Payment Page](https://www.zen-cart.com/payments.php) on the Zen Cart forum. 

### NO WARRANTY
AS WITH ANY PAID HELP SCENARIO, YOU MUST DO YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF A SERVICE-PROVIDER BEFORE ENGAGING IN A CONTRACT WITH THEM.

ZEN CART DOES NOT WARRANTY THE QUALITY OF ANY RESPONSE YOU MAY RECEIVE FROM POSTING.
