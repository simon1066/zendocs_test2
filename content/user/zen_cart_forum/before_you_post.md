## Before you post a question on the forum

### Do your homework:

*   Check the [Zen Cart documentation](/user/)

*   [Search the forum](https://www.zen-cart.com/search.php)

*   Read the Implementation Guide for a possible answer to your problem.  A link to the most current PDF Implementation Guide can be found at the top of [the release docs page](https://www.zen-cart.com/docs/).

### Done all of the above and still having a problem?

*   Post your problem in the appropriate forum category.

*   **You should include answers to all of these questions:**  

    *   What version of Zen Cart?

    *   Is it a new install or an upgrade?

    *   What plugins you have installed?

    *   What customizations have you made?

    *   What type of server are you using?

    *   Are you installing locally?  

        *   What operating system?

    *   What version of PHP is installed on the server?

    *   What version of MySQL is installed on the server?

    *   What you were doing when your problem occurred?

    *   What are the steps to reproduce the problem?

    *   Have you attempted to fix the problem?  

        *   What steps have you taken?

    *   Any other details that might be important, i.e. the port number

    If your problem is visual in nature, try switching your template back to "Classic" temporarily and see if the problem persists. Include the results of this observation in your post.

    Only post once (not multiple times on the same issue) and then be patient. We are all volunteers, we all live in different time zones, we all have lives, and the expert you need at that moment may just not be available.

    If you haven't received an answer in a reasonable amount of time **you may reply to your own post WITH MORE information**. DO NOT post "Well?" or "Can someone please help". That is considered bumping and you will probably get yelled at.

    Duplicate posts are subject to being locked or deleted, as they simply bring confusion to those helping or others reading/searching for information later, and are seen as spam-like.
