Image Galleries can be created in any of the following ways: 

- using a plugin like [ZX Gallery](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2276) 
- Writing HTML code to display your images and placing that code on a [new page](/user/customizing/add_pages/) such as an EZ-Page, a built-in extra page or a custom page you have built. 
- If you already have a gallery on an external site like Pinterest or Flickr, simply [add a link to the Information Sidebox](/user/sideboxes/add_link_information_sidebox/).
