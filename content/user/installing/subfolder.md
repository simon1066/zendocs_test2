The most common way of installing your cart is to make it your main website, so the cart files would reside directly under the `public_html` folder. 

However, it is possible to deploy your cart in a subfolder below `public_html`.  Examples of when this would make sense is if you already have a website (such as a blog or a regular website) at the top level, or you want to allow for this option in the future. 

See 
[deployment model 3](/user/first_steps/deployment_configurations/#deployment-model-3-existing-website-in-root-cart-in-subfolder)
and 
[deployment model 4](/user/first_steps/deployment_configurations/#deployment-model-4-empty-root-cart-in-subfolder) 
for examples of subfolder deployments. 

Note that if you are installing a test version of your cart that uses a different version of PHP than your live site, see [Multiple PHP Versions](/user/upgrading/multiple_php_versions/) for instructions, since the procedure is a little different.
