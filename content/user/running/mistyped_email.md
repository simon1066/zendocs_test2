A mistyped email is one of many possible causes of [undeliverable mail](/user/email/emails_not_received/#symptom-emails-sent-from-the-cart-are-not-arriving).  Frequently you will see typos like the following: 

Misspelled Email | Correct Email 
-----------------|---------------
joe@gmail.con | joe@gmail.com
joe@yaho.com | joe@yahoo.com
joe@outloook.com | joe@outlook.com
