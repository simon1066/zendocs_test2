While Zen Cart provides full ecommerce functionality, it only provides basic [stock management](/user/running/stock/). 

You will need to integrate with an external ERP if your stock handling and cost tracking needs go beyond what Zen Cart provides.  Some options are: 

- [Salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com) - A [basic integration for Salesforce](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2217) is provided as a plugin. 

- [Quickbooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/) - Integrations for Quickbooks are provided by companies like [QBI](http://qbisoftware.com/) and [Webgility](https://www.webgility.com/). 

- [Atrex](https://www.1000years.com/) - Atrex comes with a built-in Zen Cart data importer.
