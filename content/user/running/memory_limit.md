The PHP Memory Limit is the amount of memory a script is allowed to allocate, per the [PHP Documentation on this setting](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit).  Suggestions on setting this value are provided in [PHP memory limit and Zen Cart](/user/first_steps/server_requirements/#php-memory-recommendations).

In some environments, changing your PHP version can reset your memory limit setting.  Go to the [version page](/user/admin_pages/tools/server_info/) after updating PHP to verify the setting of your PHP Memory Limit.

The process of updating your PHP memory is server-specific, 
depending on whether your hoster uses PHP Selector, MultiPHP Manager or some other mechanism. See [PHP Configuration](/user/upgrading/php_configuration/) for more information on setting PHP configuration. 

Your hoster likely provides a knowledge base with instructions.  Contact your hoster if you are unsure how to proceed.
