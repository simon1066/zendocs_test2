Running a blog (WordPress), a forum (phpBB, Simple Machines), a CMS (Drupal, Joomla) or a wiki (WikiMedia) on the website where you run your shopping cart is something many Zen Cart users find attractive. 

The problem is, these software packages don't maintain themselves.  You need to keep them updated or **you run the risk of being hacked**.  Even if you keep them updated, sometimes plugins are compromised by bad guys to enable sites to be hacked.  This is not just a theoretical risk - companies like Securi get most of their business from WordPress installations that have been hacked. 

So: you can do this, many people do this, but it has a cost and you'll need to devote more energy to maintenance and updates if you want go down this path. Proceed with caution.  This topic is discussed in more depth in [installing additional software packages](/user/running/additional_software/). 

Most people who deploy blogs or other tools use [deployment model 2](/user/first_steps/deployment_configurations/).

What are some alternative options to running a blog with your Zen Cart installation?

### Adding Content Pages to your Cart 

The Zen Cart [EZ-Pages](/user/ezpages/) system allows you to create content using a secure, controlled facility.  This content can then be displayed on your site.   You can even organize your pages into chapters and have a table of contents. 

There are also other mechanisms for [adding pages to your site](/user/customizing/add_pages/). 

### Use News Box Manager 
The [News Box Manager](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2264) plugin allows you to create new pages for your site.

### Create and send a newsletter regularly

Creating and building an email list using a [newsletter](/user/email/newsletters/) is a great way to develop a community.

Tools like MailChimp have inexpensive offerings for small businesses that allow you to stay in touch with your customers.  You can even preserve your content in a [campaign archive](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-email-campaign-archives-and-pages/) so customers who come along after you sent it can still see it. 

### Use a static site generator 

Static Site Generators (SSGs) like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) allow you to build a sophisticated website using a tool, and output raw HTML which can run without a database or code interpretation.  Since  the final output of these tools is HTML-only, it is much less risky than WordPress (which has both PHP and MySQL as potential attack surfaces). 

### Create a blog offsite

Really committed to a blog, are you?  Instead of self-hosting a WordPress blog, why not use [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) and let them host it.  There are, of course, other hosted blogging services like [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) or [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/). 

### Consider community building software 
For some businesses, building a community makes sense.  Take a look at [Wild Apricot](https://wildapricot.com) or [Mighty Networks](https://www.mightynetworks.com/) or [Tribe.so](https://tribe.so).

### Use the News Box Manager plugin 

See [News Box Manager](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2264).
