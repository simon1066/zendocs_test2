## Standard Checkout 
By default, the Zen Cart checkout process is a three page checkout: 

- choose shipping details 
- choose payment details 
- confirm order

Once checkout has been confirmed, a success page is shown. 

Screenshots of those pages are provided in [the Storefront Checkout pages FAQ](/user/storefront_pages/checkout/).

## One Page Checkout 

Via a plugin, Zen Cart also offers [One Page Checkout](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2095).  Some storeowners find this a more friendly experience for their customers.  The One Page checkout screen looks like this:

Successful completion of one page checkout also redirects to the standard Zen Cart checkout success page [shown here](/user/storefront_pages/checkout/#success-page). 

Many more details on One Page Checkout are provided in the [Github Repo for OPC](https://github.com/lat9/one_page_checkout).
