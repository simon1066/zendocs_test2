**Issue:** When I visit my page, I get the error message, "Sorry, the page you were attempting to access cannot be found." 

This means you have not configured the EZPage correctly.  You need to set 
the radio button to *Yes* and the sort order to a value > 0 for either the
Header, the Sidebox or the Footer.  Alternately, in Zen Cart 1.5.6 and above,
you can set the *Page is Visible* radio button to *Yes*.  See the help for [Tools > EZ-Pages](/user/admin_pages/tools/ezpages/) for more details.
