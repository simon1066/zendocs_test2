The PCI rules for password management require that admin users change their password every 90 days.

So, after 90 days has elapsed, the next time you log in to your Admin it will ask you to change your password. Simply follow the prompts to select a new password. Per PCI rules, you cannot re-use the last 4 passwords.

**NOTE:** Don't be alarmed by the word "expire." THE SYSTEM DOES NOT "lock you out" when your password "expires." It merely requires you to change the password. As long as you know the last-valid password it will let you login (after also choosing a new password).

If you don't want to change it now, you will not be allowed to complete login. But your current password will let you get back to the change-your-password screen again.

See [An overview of password requirements for Zen Cart](/user/security/passwords/) for more details.

Keeping track of passwords and generating new secure passwords is easier with a [password manager](/user/first_steps/security/#use-a-password-manager).
