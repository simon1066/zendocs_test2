Symptom: Instead of showing a product image thumbnail and the product's name, I'm seeing just the product name, but twice!


Cause: When an image is called there is an ALT tag and that ALT tag is the Product Name, but since you do not have images, in your browser you see the ALT Tag Product Name.  Since they are the same thing, it looks like 2 names.


Solution: Give images to your products.
