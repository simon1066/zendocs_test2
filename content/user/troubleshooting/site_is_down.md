"My Site Is Down!" can feel like a scary situation.

But first one must determine what "down" means.

If you're seeing a blank page with no error message, or just a "partially blank page", see the other Troubleshooting docs about those subjects.

If your browser is telling you a message like "Server Not Responding" or "ERR_NOT_CONNECTED" then perhaps your site's server is down.

To test whether there may actually be a server problem, try these tools:


- [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com) can test your site and its performance.

- [DownForEveryoneOrJustMe](https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com) to test the site from somewhere else.

- [GeoPeeker](https://www.geopeeker.com) to view the site from 6 places around the world.

- [BetterUptime](https://betteruptime.com/?ref=ma9) monitors your site, notifies you by email/phone/SMS if it stops responding, and lets you create Status pages.

- [NodePing](https://nodeping.com/?rid=2011092618071CZGM) monitors your site's essential services and notifies you by email or SMS when problems occur.

- [SSL Validator](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html) can check your SSL certificates to be sure there isn't something wrong with them that might be blocking visitors from connecting to your server.

- [MXToolbox SuperTool](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx) can check for DNS and other domain configuration problems.

And of course, contact your Hosting Company for assistance if the site is indeed down (not responding).
