The Brands page shows the manufacturers for a store, and allows customers to view all products from a particular manufacturer.

When a manufacturer's logo is clicked, the customer sees a [product listing](/user/storefront_pages/product_listing/) page showing that manufacturer's products.

A link to the Brands page may optionally be displayed in the [Information Sidebox](/user/sideboxes/information_sidebox/) 
using the [site specific overrides](/user/customizing/site_specific_overrides/) file.
