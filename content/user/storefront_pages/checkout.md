By default, the Zen Cart checkout process is a three page checkout:

- choose shipping details
- choose payment details
- confirm order

Once checkout has been confirmed, a success page is shown.

## One Page Checkout
Via a plugin, Zen Cart also offers [One Page Checkout](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2095).  Some storeowners find this a more friendly experience for their customers. More information and a screenshot of this page is shown in the [Checkout FAQ](/user/running/checkout/).
