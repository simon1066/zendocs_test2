In Zen Cart 1.5.8 and higher, the About Us page is built in.

Prior to Zen Cart 1.5.8, the About Us page was provided as a plugin: 

- [About Us](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=86) 
- [Skinny About Us](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2198) 
The latter is somewhat less customizable but contains fewer files. 

You may use the About Us page to show content about your store that is designed to build credibility. 

A link to the About Us page may optionally be displayed in the [Information Sidebox](/user/sideboxes/information_sidebox/). To do this: 

- In 1.5.8 and above, use the [site specific overrides](/user/customizing/site_specific_overrides/) file.  
- Prior to this, use the instructions in 
[adding a link to the Information Sidebox](/user/sideboxes/add_link_information_sidebox/).
