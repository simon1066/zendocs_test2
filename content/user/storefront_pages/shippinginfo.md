The shipping and returns page for your store may be accessed at `index.php?main_page=shippinginfo`.  You can fill in the details using the [Define Pages Editor](/user/admin_pages/tools/define_pages/). 

If so configured in [Admin > Configuration > Define Pages](/user/template/define_pages/), a link to the Shipping page will show in the [Information Sidebox](/user/sideboxes/information_sidebox/).
