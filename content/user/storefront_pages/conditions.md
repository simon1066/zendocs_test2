The terms and conditions page for your store may be accessed at `index.php?main_page=conditions`.  You can fill in the details using the [Define Pages Editor](/user/admin_pages/tools/define_pages/). 

You may display a link to your terms and conditions (and condition checkout upon their acceptance) using the `Confirm Terms and Conditions During Checkout Procedure` setting in [Admin > Configuration > Regulations](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_regulations/).

If so configured in [Admin > Configuration > Define Pages](/user/template/define_pages/), a link to the Conditions page will show in the [Information Sidebox](/user/sideboxes/information_sidebox/).
