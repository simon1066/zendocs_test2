The privacy page for your store may be accessed at `index.php?main_page=privacy`.  You can fill in the details using the [Define Pages Editor](/user/admin_pages/tools/define_pages/). 

You may display a link to your privacy policy (and condition account creation upon their acceptance) using the `Confirm Privacy Notice During Account Creation Procedure` setting in [Admin > Configuration > Regulations](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_regulations/).

If so configured in [Admin > Configuration > Define Pages](/user/template/define_pages/), a link to the Privacy page will show in the [Information Sidebox](/user/sideboxes/information_sidebox/).
