New users sometimes ask, "Why don't order total modules change item prices?"

Because that's not how [order total modules](/user/order_total/order_total/) work. They apply to the **total** order value, not to
any individual product.  So they are line items which are added or subtracted after the Sub-Total is computed. 

There are ways to *reduce* individual product prices - you can use [Sales](/user/admin_pages/catalog/salemaker/) or [Specials](/user/admin_pages/catalog/specials/), for example.
See [Price Reductions](/user/products/price_reductions/) for more details. 

There are ways to *increase* individual product prices through [attributes](/user/products/attributes/).
