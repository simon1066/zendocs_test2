Zen Cart permits you to add fees to specific types of orders.

- COD Fee - a COD fee may be applied to any shipping module.

- Low Order Fee - if small orders incur costs for your business that make them unprofitable, you may add a low order fee. 

There are also [plugins which allow you to charge fees](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=7).
