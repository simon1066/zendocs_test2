Zen Cart permits you to add discounts to specific types of orders.

* [Coupons](/user/order_total/coupons/) - Create discount coupons for price reductions and free shipping 

* [Group Pricing](/user/order_total/group_pricing/) - Offer discounts to groups of customers

There are also [plugins which allow you to discount and reduce the order total](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=7). 

The discounts described above are *order total* discounts, which means they reduce the order total.  There are also product discounts which reduce the price of an individual product.  Take a look at:
