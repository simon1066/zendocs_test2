Order Total modules allow you to add a surcharge or a discount to the order.  They also display computed values, such as the order subtotal and order total. 

The list of available order total modules may be seen by going to [Admin > Modules > Order Total](/user/admin_pages/modules/order_total/).

Zen Cart has a number of built-in order total modules which allow you to 
increase or reduce the total owed based on various factors in the order.
*Increasing* the total is done using [fees](/user/order_total/default_fees/). 
*Reducing* the total is done using [discounts](/user/order_total/default_discounts). 

All the line items in an order below the cart contents are order totals.
This means the Sub-Total, Tax, Shipping, and Total are displayed via order total modules. 

Plugins provide a number of additional fee and discount options: 

- [Gift Wrapping](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=267)
- [Better Together](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=201)
- [Quantity Discounts](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=135)

More order total plugins may be found in the [Other Modules section of the Plugins Library](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=cat&id=7).
