The extension empowers you to identify issues promptly, receive detailed reports, and take proactive steps toward improving accessibility.

* **Real-Time Accessibility Analysis** - After installation, the extension works seamlessly while browsing the web.

The report categorizes accessibility issues into clear sections, making it easy for you to understand and address each problem.

It helps you ensure that all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard, enhancing the user experience for those who rely on assistive technologies.
