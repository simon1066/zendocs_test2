[UPS integration](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2374) is provided as a [plugin for Zen Cart](/user/plugins/why_plugins/). 

UPS updated its API in mid 2023.  The plugin which uses their newest API is called [UPS Shipping using RESTful API](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2374).  Installation instructions for this module are [here](https://github.com/lat9/upsoauth/wiki). 

There were formerly two other options, 
[UPS Shipping Module](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1293) and 
[UPS XML](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=126), 
but both of those have been deprecated by UPS.
