[FedEx integration](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2375) is provided as a [plugin for Zen Cart](/user/plugins/why_plugins/). 

FedEx updated its API in mid 2023.  The plugin which uses their newest API is called [FedEx REST API](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2375).  Installation instructions for this module are [here](https://github.com/scottcwilson/zencart_fedexrest/wiki/Installation-Instructions).

There was formerly another option called [FedEx Web Services](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1784), but that has been deprecated by FedEx.
