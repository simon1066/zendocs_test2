Most stores allow customers to visit, browse and buy the same day with no prior approval.  However, it is possible to configure your store with restrictions on this process.

The [Customer Approval Status](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_customerdetails/#customer_approval_status__authorization_pending) setting allows you to set restrictions on customers in three possible ways: 

```
1= Must be Authorized to Browse
```
This means customers are locked out of the store until they are approved. 
This is the highest level of restriction available.  It is suitable for 
"Members-only" stores, or stores which are designed for a company intranet. 

```
2= May browse but no prices unless Authorized
```

This setting allows potential customers to create accounts and look at products,
but not see prices until an administrator approves them.  

```
3= Customer May Browse and May see Prices but Must be Authorized to Buy
```

This setting allows potential customers to create accounts and shop, but not complete transactions until they are approved.
