Whether or not to include taxes when displaying prices is a global setting, which is enabled with the "Display Prices with Tax" setting in [Admin > Configuration > My Store](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_mystore/).

In the same place, there is a separate setting which determines whether or not to show prices with tax included in the Admin.
