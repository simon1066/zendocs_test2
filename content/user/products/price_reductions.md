There are a variety of ways products can be discounted in Zen Cart: 

- Using [Specials](/user/products/special_products/) or [Sales](/user/products/sale_products/)
- Using [Quantity Discounts](/user/products/quantity_discounts/)
- Using an [Order Total Module](/user/order_total/order_total/) such as Group Pricing or Coupons.
- Since Zen Cart 2.0.0, using [wholesale pricing](/user/products/wholesale_pricing).

Each of these results in a price reduction which is presented in a different way.

Specials and Sales display the reduced price on the listing and product info pages, with the original price shown in strikethrough:

Quantity Discounts show a reduced price on the shopping cart page and checkout pages as more items are purchased.
Here's a purchase of 1 item, at $15.

Here's a purchase of 10 of those items, at $13.80.

Order Totals show a discount in the order summary on the checkout payment and checkout confirmation pages. The per-item price is *not* reduced.
