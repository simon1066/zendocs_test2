There are two setups required in order to allow customers to purchase in quantities less than 1:

1. Change a setting in your admin:  Admin > Configuration > Stock > Product Quantity Decimals :  Set to 2 instead of 0

2. Then individually edit each applicable product's settings to allow minimum units of 0.01 or whatever you need.
