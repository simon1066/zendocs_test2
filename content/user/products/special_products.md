[Specials](/user/admin_pages/catalog/specials/) allow you to discount single products. Specials are sometimes contrasted with [Sales](/user/products/sale_products/), which allow you to discount one or more categories of products. 

Once you have done this, Zen Cart has a number of ways for you to show off your specials: 

- the built-in Specials Page, which appears when you navigate to `YOURSITE.com/index.php?main_page=specials`.
- the optional Specials [Sidebox](/user/template/sideboxes/) 
- the optional Specials [Centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes/)

You may also configure specials to appear in the following places: 

- on an empty shopping cart page with the setting on [Admin > Configuration > Stock](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_stock/)
- below a [product listing page](/user/storefront_pages/listing_pages/) using the settings on [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/)

Creating Specials is done on the [Admin > Catalog > Specials](/user/admin_pages/catalog/specials/) page. 

Specials have configurable [start and end dates](/user/products/start_end_dates/) so you don't have to turn them on or off by hand if you don't want to.

Specials directly reduce the displayed price of a product.  See [Price Reductions](/user/products/price_reductions/).
