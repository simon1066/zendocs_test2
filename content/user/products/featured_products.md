[Featured Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/featured/) allow you to highlight 
products for display in various places. 

Once you have created some featured products, Zen Cart has a number of ways for you to show them off: 

- the built-in Featured Products page, which appears when you navigate to `YOURSITE.com/index.php?main_page=featured_products`.
- the optional Featured Products [Sidebox](/user/template/sideboxes/) 
- the optional Featured Products [Centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes/)

You may also configure featured products to appear in the following places: 

- on an empty shopping cart page with the setting on [Admin > Configuration > Stock](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_stock/)
- below a [product listing page](/user/storefront_pages/listing_pages/) using the settings on [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/)

Adding a product to the featured products list is done on the [Admin > Catalog > Featured Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/featured/) page. 

The display of items on the Featured Products page is controlled as follows: 
- In v2.0.0 and higher, on the [Admin > Configuration > Product Listing page](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productlisting/).  Setting the Display values on this page is described in greater detail in [New Listing - Featured Listing - All Listing configuration settings](/user/template/new_featured_all_listing_page_configuration/). 
- In v1.5.8a and lower, on the [Admin > Configuration > Featured Listing page](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_featuredlisting/).  Setting the Display values on this page is described in greater detail in [New Listing - Featured Listing - All Listing configuration settings for v1.x.x](/user/template/new_featured_all_listing_page_configuration/).
