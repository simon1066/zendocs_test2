Some jurisdictions require displayed prices to include tax.  So a $10 item with a 10% tax applicable in the store's zone would be displayed with a price of $11.00.  

If you need to display prices with taxes included, follow these steps: 

- [Set up your taxes](/user/taxes/vat/)
- [Configure tax inclusive pricing](/user/taxes/tax_inclusive_pricing)
