[Sales](/user/admin_pages/catalog/salemaker/) allow you to discount entire categories of products. Sales are sometimes contrasted with [Specials](/user/products/special_products/), which allow you to discount a single product. 

There are no built-in centerboxes or pages to show sales, although the [What's on Sale](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1185) plugin is available. 

Creating Sales is done on the [Admin > Catalog > SaleMaker](/user/admin_pages/catalog/salemaker/) page. 

Sales have configurable [start and end dates](/user/products/start_end_dates/) so you don't have to turn them on or off by hand if you don't want to.

Sales directly reduce the displayed price of a product.  See [Price Reductions](/user/products/price_reductions/).
