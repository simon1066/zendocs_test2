### How do I add a new category?

Go to [Admin > Catalog > Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories/).  Drill down to the level where you want to add the category.  

Click the new category button.

On the next page fill in the category name, description, and other information, and click *Save*.

**Note:** A category can hold sub-categories or products, but not both at the same level.  See [products and categories at the same level](/user/troubleshooting/products_categories_same_level).

### How do I delete a category? 

Go to [Admin > Catalog > Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories/).  Drill down to the level where you see the category.  

Click the red trash can icon on the right side of the page.

From the next page, choose *Delete*. 

**NOTE:** Deleting a top level category will remove the subcategories and products it contains.
