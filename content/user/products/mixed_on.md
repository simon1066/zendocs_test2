On the [product editing page](/user/products/product_edit/), 
there are a number of [settings related to sale quantities](/user/products/product_units/).  One of them is called Product Qty Min/Unit Mix . 

When the setting `Product Qty Minimum` is greater than 1, the 
setting `Product Qty Min/Unit Mix` is used in determining 
whether the minimum has been met, both for purchasing and for 
[quantity discounts](/user/products/quantity_discounts/). 

If you have the Minimum set to 36 with `Product Qty Min/Unit Mix` = `Yes`, the "MIXED: ON" status message shows.

Mixed ON means that they can "mix" or match Attributes to build the 36 Minimum setting.  For example, 12 Red 14 Yellow 10 Green meets the minimum restriction of 36. 

Mixed OFF means that they cannot "mix" the Attributes to build the 36 Minimum setting. For example, you must have 36 Red and/or 36 Yellow and/or 36 Green
to meet the minimum restriction of 36
