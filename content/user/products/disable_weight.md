First, let's be clear about the difference between a [listing page](/user/storefront_pages/listing_pages/) and the [product info](/user/storefront_pages/product_info/) page. When you see a number of products listed together, that's a listing page. For example, the New Products page is a listing page.  The page showing all products in a category is also a listing page called the _product listing page_.  When you click on one of the individual products in a list, you will be taken to the product info page.

To turn off weight on the product listing pages, login to your Admin area and then choose [Configuration > Product Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productlisting/), then select *Display Product Weight* and set it to 0.  The other New, Featured and All Products listing pages each have their own configuration menus. 

You may have spotted the Product Info entry on the Configuration menu and already be there to do the same for product info. STOP.

The Product info page works differently from the listing pages. This is because of the flexibility that Zen Cart gives you to define different product types. You may wish, for example, to display a weight for a book, but not for a downloadable pdf. Zen Cart allows you to set them up as different product types and display different information about them.

So where do you go to turn off display of a products weight? Follow
the instructions on [turning off fields from the product page](/user/template/basic_customizations/#can-i-turn-off-fields-from-my-product-info-page).
