The field _product model_ is used by some stores as a unique identifier to track items in the store. Some vendors call this a SKU or stock keeping unit. We'll use the term "model number" in this FAQ.

The model number does not have to be numeric, although model numbers are generally alphanumeric, with dashes or underscores sometimes used. 

Using a model number is completely optional, and won't make sense for some stores. 

If you do use model numbers, you may wish to ensure that they are unique. The plugin [Find Duplicate Models](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1323) may be used for this.   This process is very important for stores that use Quickbooks or other external systems that require unique model identifiers. 

Note that model numbers beginning with the string "GIFT" are reserved for [gift certificates](/user/order_total/gift_certificates/) only, and should not be used for other products.
