Zen Cart has a number of ways for you to show off new products: 

- the built-in New Products Page, configured under [Configuration > New Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_newlisting/).  This page appears when you navigate to `YOURSITE.com/index.php?main_page=products_new`.
- the optional New Products [Sidebox](/user/template/sideboxes/) 
- the optional New Products [Centerbox](/user/template/centerboxes/)

You may also configure new products to appear in the following places: 

- on an empty shopping cart page with the setting on [Admin > Configuration > Stock](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_stock/)
- below a [product listing page](/user/storefront_pages/listing_pages/) using the settings on [Admin > Configuration > Index Listing](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_indexlisting/)


Determination of what qualifies as "new" is also configurable, using 
[Admin > Configuration > Maximum Values > New Product Listing - Limited to ... ](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_maximumvalues/#new_product_listing__limited_to_).

The display of items on the New Products page is controlled as follows:
- In v2.0.0 and higher, on the [Admin > Configuration > Product Listing page](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_productlisting/).  Setting the Display values on this page is described in greater detail in [New Listing - Featured Listing - All Listing configuration settings](/user/template/new_featured_all_listing_page_configuration/). 
- In v1.5.8a and lower, on the [Admin > Configuration > New Listing page](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_newlisting/).  Setting the Display values on this page is described in greater detail in [New Listing - Featured Listing - All Listing configuration settings for v1.x.x](/user/template/new_featured_all_listing_page_configuration/).
