The numbers next to the category names on the [categories sidebox](/user/sideboxes/categories_sidebox/) are the category/inventory counts. 

![Categories Sidebox](/images/sidebox_categories.png)

If you want to change whether these are shown or not, go to [Admin > Configuration > My Store](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_mystore/). 
Locate the *Show Category Counts* option, and turn them on or off.
