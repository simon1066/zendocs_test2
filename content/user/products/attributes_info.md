Zen Cart allows you to create variant products using its built-in 
attributes mechanism. 

Example: 

- A shirt in sizes small, medium and large.
- A book in hardcover or paperback 

Without attributes, you would have to have three shirt products (one for each size) and two book products (one for each binding). 

Zen Cart offers the following types of attributes:

- radio buttons 
- checkboxes 
- drop-down lists 
- text boxes 
- file uploads 
- file downloads
- read only attributes 

Here's an example from the Zen Cart demo data.  
This is a cropped view of the product info page for one of the same products.
The product has a dropdown
attribute called *Media Type*, and three checkbox attributes.
