Zen Cart uses the term "product info page" to refer to a page that shows a single product, versus the [listing page](/user/storefront_pages/listing_pages/) page, which shows a number of products.   

Products without [attributes](/user/products/attributes_info/) may be purchased off other pages (with appropriate settings), but only the product info page allows you to set attribute values 
for products with attributes. 

The product info page also allows you to show the products description and other fields that give more information about the product to your customers. 

The information which appears on the product info page is governed by the
product type and the [product type layout settings](/user/admin_pages/catalog/product_types_edit_layout/) for that product type. 

Almost everyone uses the product type `Product - General` only, but other
product types are available, and you may develop new ones to meet your needs.  See [Product Types](/dev/code/product_types/) for more information.

For more information, please see [product info page](/user/storefront_pages/product_info/).
