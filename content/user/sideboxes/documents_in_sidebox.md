You create a new category of products that describe your documents (for example, category **Recipes**), and then create products within that category (**individual recipes**). 

- In [Admin > Catalog > Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories/), make your category (say it's *Recipes*).

- Edit the category, and set to product type: Document General

- Go into this category, and [create your products, the recipes](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/).

By restricting the category to Document General your Recipes category will now show in the Document Box and not the categories box.
You can add other restricted product types too, but Document General will make this one show in the Document Box and not the categories box.
