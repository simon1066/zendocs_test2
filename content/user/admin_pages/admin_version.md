The `Version` link at the top right hand side or your admin page takes you to the 
[Tools > Server/Version Info](/user/admin_pages/tools/server_info/) page. 

It shows information about your server configuration,
including PHP and MySQL versions and settings, as well as 
your Zen Cart version and database history. 

**Clicking this link is the fastest way to get your store's version information**.
Providing this information when asking for support will help improve the usefulness of the responses you get and avoid having to be asked for it.

If your hoster updated your PHP version, be aware that if you're running an old version of Zen Cart, you could have problems - refer to the [PHP Version - Zen Cart version compatibility matrix](/user/first_steps/server_requirements/#php-version).
