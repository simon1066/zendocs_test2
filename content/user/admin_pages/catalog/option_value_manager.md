The Option Value Manager allows you to manage option values for each option name. 

![Option Value Manager](/images/option_value_manager.png)

Before you create option values you need to create option names in [Admin - Catalog - Option Name Manager](/user/admin_pages/catalog/option_name_manager/).

## Creating an Option Value

![Option Value Editing](/images/edit_option_value.png)

- In the dropdown box select which option name you would like to add a value to.
- In the first text box 

    en: - type in the option value title that your customers will see (e.g. If your option name is a dropdown box for sizes then in this box you would write one of your sizes). Repeat all four steps for each size.

- In the second text box 

    Order: - type in the sort order you would like your option value to be in.

- Click Insert.

To edit an option value click Edit and once changes are made click Update.

### Filtering by Option Name 

Since Zen Cart 1.5.7, you have been able to filter the list of option values to only those for a particular option name.  This makes it much easier to work on large lists of option values.

### Global Features 

Below the list of options are three more forms that allow you to do the following changes across many products at a time.  Note these forms will only show if the dropdown *Display Global Features* at the top of the page  is set to *On*. 

This image shows one of the three forms as an example: 

![Copy to ALL Products](/images/copy_to_all_products.png)

The global features offered on this page are as follows: 

- Copy a new Option Name and Value to all products[^1] with an existing Option Name and Value (shown above)
- Delete an option Name and Value from all products[^1] 
- Copy a new Option Name and Value to all products[^1] with an existing Option Name

The first and third forms are similar; the difference is the first form requires that a product have a specific option name *and value*, whereas the third only requires that a product have a specific option name. 

[^1]: instead of all products, a single category of products may be specified.
