Customers enter reviews by clicking the *Write Review* button on 
the storefront's [product info](/user/products/product_info/) page, or from the [product reviews info page](/user/storefront_pages/reviews/), which shows a single product's reviews.  They must be logged in to leave a review.

Reviews are displayed in the storefront in the following places:

- [Product Reviews sidebox](/user/sideboxes/sidebox_list/#reviews) 
- [Product Reviews page](/user/storefront_pages/reviews/)

You may configure whether or not reviews then require admin approval using
the [Product Reviews Require Approval](/user/admin_pages/configuration/all/#product_reviews_require_approval) setting on  the Configuration > Product Info screen.
