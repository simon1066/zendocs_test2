This page allows you to add meta tags to products. 

You may modify the contents of the product's `<title>` tag 
so that individual product fields (such as model, price and name) are shown.

You may also add to the title field, and set meta_keywords and meta_description.

The Products Meta Tags Editor is reached from the [Admin > Catalog > Categories/Products](/user/admin_pages/catalog/categories_products/) page at the products level. 

The default values for the settings in the first image are set on the [Product Types Layout Editor](/user/admin_pages/catalog/product_types_edit_layout/) screen.
