This page allows you to view, add, edit or delete manufacturer information. You might also refer to these as Brands.

**Note:** Not all stores will use manufacturers (especially if they manufacture their own items).  If you don't need manufacturer information, ignore this screen and the manufacturer data entry field on the [product editing page](/user/products/product_edit/). 

A list of manufacturers is displayed when you open the screen.

Manufacturers are shown on the storefront in the [manufacturers sidebox](/user/sideboxes/sidebox_list/#manufacturers) and the [brands page](/user/storefront_pages/brands/).
