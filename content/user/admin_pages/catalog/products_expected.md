This admin page allows you to see all  the products which have a 
*Date Available* field set to a future date. 

Such products are called "Upcoming Products" (and were called "Expected Products" prior to Zen Cart 1.5.8). 

From this page, you may edit any product in the list of upcoming products. 

The Date Available field is set on the [Product Editing screen](/user/products/product_edit/). 

Since Zen Cart 1.5.7, you may also automate the change from disabled to enabled when the available date is reached using the [enable disabled product by available date](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_stock/#enable_disabled_product_by_available_date) feature.
