This page allows you to view and edit downloadable items. 

![Downloads Manager](/images/downloads_manager.png) 

Each downloadable file is shown, along with its product and attribute combination.  This allows you to easily determine which download is associated with which product.  The small circle next to the filename indicates whether this file is in the expected place (the `DIR_FS_DOWNLOAD` folder). 

A sidebar to the right of each file allows you to easily edit the attributes or the product.

It also allows you to quickly reset the associated filename for a download, or its limitation on available days and downloads.
