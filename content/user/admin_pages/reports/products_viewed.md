This report lists of the number of times each product has been "viewed" (page visited).

The default reporting range is "the past year", but you can change this as needed. 

**Note:** In Zen Cart 1.5.7, the products_viewed data gathering was refactored to improve performance, so for upgraders from pre_1.5.7 to 1.5.7 or above, data will not be available for the interval prior to the upgrade date. Prior to v1.5.7 the numbers could not be filtered by a date range: they represented "all views since the counters were reset to 0".
