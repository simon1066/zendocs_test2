This report shows all your products, ranked in sales order.

The Products Purchased Report queries the `orders_products` table to get an exact count of the number of products sold.  

**Note:** This is different from how the [Bestsellers Sidebox](/user/sideboxes/sidebox_list/#best-sellers) is built: the bestsellers list is based on the `products_ordered` field in the `products` table, which can be manipulated using the `Reset ALL Products Ordered` button in the [Store Manager](/user/admin_pages/tools/store_manager/).
