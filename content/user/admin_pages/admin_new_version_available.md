If you are running an older version of Zen Cart, a message will appear at 
the top right hand side of your Admin page, reminding you to upgrade. 

![New Zen Cart Version available](/images/new_version.png) 

This message can be disabled by setting `Show if version update available` to `false` in [Admin > Configuration > My Store](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_mystore/). 

When you do that, instead of a new version announcement, you'll see a link that allows you to check for a new version.

In addition to this message, [subscribing to release announcements](/user/about_us/announcements) is a great way to stay informed about new releases and security updates.
