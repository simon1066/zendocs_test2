This page allows you to send email to your customers. Individual customers may be selected, or pre-defined groupings may be used.

If your store uses HTML email, you will have an additional text box in which to enter the HTML content to be sent. 

**NOTE:** Sending large numbers of emails (newsletters or other marketing content) from your hosting account is no longer recommended. 
See [Newsletters](/user/email/newsletters/) for alternatives. 

For more information, see the [email FAQs](/user/email/).

You can reach the Send Email screen either from Admin > Tools > Send Email, or from [Admin > Customers > Customers](/user/admin_pages/customers/customers/), selecting a customer and pressing the *Email* button.
