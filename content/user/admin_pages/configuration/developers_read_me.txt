Please do not hand edit these files; they are created automatically from a 
fresh install of the latest release. 

If you find a typo: 
- Report it on the forum.  The page will be corrected, and the 
typo will be fixed in the schema creation script and the next version's
update script. 

If you want to add content to a page:
- Report it on the forum.  The build process will be updated to add it. 
You can see an example where this has been done at 

https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_email/#email_archiving_active

In the unlikely event that a new configuration menu is added, please update 
content/user/admin_pages/configuration/all.md

The code that created these `.md` files is the `build_doc.php` script, which is stored at https://github.com/scottcwilson/zencart_tools.
