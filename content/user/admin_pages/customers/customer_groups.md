The Customer Groups page allows you to view your customer groups. This is a new feature which was added in Zen Cart 1.5.8. 


It shows your groups in a paginated list, with one line per customer. 
The most recently added group is shown first.

The columns in the list are: 

- Group ID
- Group Name 
- Count of customers in group
- Description of group 
 
Clicking a group record selects that group and opens a preview on the right hand side of the page.  From there, the group record may be edited or deleted.  

A customer may only belong to one [pricing group](/user/admin_pages/customers/group_pricing/), but may be in any number of customer groups. 

The Groups feature is highly specific to store needs.  See [Using Customer Groups](/user/customizing/customer_groups) for ideas.
