The Orders Invoice page allows you to view an invoice for a particular order.

In this context, "invoice" means a summary of the order, not an account to be paid.  

The invoice contains the full order information, in contrast to the [packing slip](/user/admin_pages/customers/orders_packingslip/), which only contains the products in the order.

Some display features on this page may be switched off and on - see [switchable features on order pages](/user/admin_pages/customers/order_display_options/).
