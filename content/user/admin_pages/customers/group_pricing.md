The Group Pricing page allows you to create customer pricing groups.  These can be used to give group discounts if you enable `Admin > Modules > Order Total > Group Pricing`. 

For more information on group discounts, see the [group pricing FAQ](/user/order_total/group_pricing/). 

Starting in Zen Cart 2.0.0, an alternative pricing mechanism called [wholesale pricing](/user/products/wholesale_pricing/) is available.

A separate concept of [customer group](/user/admin_pages/customers/customer_groups/) exists in Zen Cart 1.5.8 and above. A customer may only belong to a single customer pricing group, but may belong to any number of customer groups.
