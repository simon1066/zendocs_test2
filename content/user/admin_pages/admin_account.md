The `Admin > Account` page allows the currently-logged-in Admin user to change their email address or reset their password.

Administrators with an un-restricted [Admin Profile](/user/admin_pages/admins/admin_profiles/) can perform these same changes 
for other admin users using the [Admins > Admin Users](/user/admin_pages/admins/admin_users/) page.
