The following are options for giving a customer store credit rather than a payment refund: 

- [Send them a Gift Certificate](/user/admin_pages/discounts/send_gift_certificate/)

- Create a 100% off one-time use [coupon](/user/order_total/coupons/) for the amount owed. 

The older Store Credit plugin is no longer supported.
