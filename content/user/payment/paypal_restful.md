**This module is now production ready: https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2382**

PayPal RESTful is a new integration with PayPal which uses the 
[PayPal REST API](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/).
It is expected to replace both PayPal Express and PayPal Website Payments Pro.

PayPal RESTful will run on Zen Cart 1.5.8a and higher.

PayPal RESTful is compatible with both [standard three page checkout](/user/storefront_pages/checkout/) and [one page checkout](/user/running/checkout/).

Storeowners who currently process orders using PayPal Express and/or PayPal Website Payments Pro will want to [retire](/user/payment/retirement/) those modules when they enable PayPal RESTful - having both enabled will be confusing. 

At this time, PayPal RESTful does not support Venmo or Pay Later/Pay in 4.
