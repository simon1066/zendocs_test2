To find out what version of Zen Cart or PHP or MySQL you are currently using, there are two options that both get you what you need.

You can click [Version](/user/admin_pages/admin_version/) on the top right navigation menu.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![Version Link](/images/skinny_version.png)

Or you can go to [Admin > Tools > Server/Version Info](/user/admin_pages/tools/server_info/).  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ![Tools Version Link](/images/tools_server_version.png)

<br>

Either of these options will take you to the [Server/Version Info](/user/admin_pages/tools/server_info) page.

On that screen you will see a lot of detail about your server configuration. Your Zen Cart version will be shown, as well as your server's PHP version, MySQL version, database parameters, PHP settings, and more.

You can also see your database upgrade history.

Version information is particularly important if you are upgrading Zen Cart 
or your hoster is upgrading PHP.  You want to be sure you have a 
[compatible PHP for your Zen Cart version](/user/first_steps/server_requirements/). 

**Note:** 
- If you are writing code and you need to do a version check, see [Zen Cart Version Checking in your Plugin](/dev/plugins/version/).
- If you are looking for the version check message that appears in the upper right hand corner of the admin, see [New Version message](/user/admin_pages/admin_new_version_available/).
