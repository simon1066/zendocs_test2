The EZ-Pages footer bar is an area in the bottom part of your storefront display that shows links to your EZ-Pages.   In the [page format description](/user/template/page_format/#footer), it is the black bar with links to Home, My Account, Site Map, etc. 

### How do I turn off the EZ-Pages footer bar? 
There are two ways to turn off the EZ-Pages footer bar. Firstly, it won't show if there are no links there, so turning off all links in the footer (Admin > Tools > EZ-Pages) would also suppress display of the bar itself.  Just make all the LEDs in the Footer column in [Tools > EZ-Pages](/user/admin_pages/tools/ezpages/) turn red.

Even quicker would be to go to Admin > Configuration > EZ-Pages Settings and set the value of "EZ-Pages Display Status - FooterBar" to zero.  See [EZ-Pages Display Status - FooterBar](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_ezpagessettings/#ezpages_display_status__footerbar).
