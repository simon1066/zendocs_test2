The EZ-Pages header bar is an area in the upper part of your storefront display that shows links to your EZ-Pages.   In the [page format description](/user/template/page_format/), it is part (f). 

### How do I turn off the EZ-Pages header bar? 
There are two ways to turn off the EZ-Pages header bar. Firstly, it won't show if there are no links there, so turning off all links in the header (Admin > Tools > EZ-Pages) would also suppress display of the bar itself.  Just make all the
LEDs in the Header column in [Tools > EZ-Pages](/user/admin_pages/tools/ezpages/) turn red.

Even quicker would be to go to Admin > Configuration > EZ-Pages Settings and set the value of "EZ-Pages Display Status - FooterBar" to zero.  See [EZ-Pages Display Status - HeaderBar](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_ezpagessettings/#ezpages_display_status__headerbar).
