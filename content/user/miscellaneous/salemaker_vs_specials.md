Specials | Salemaker
---------|----------
Specials allow you to target price reductions at individual products. | Salemaker is used to create a policy for reducing prices and then applying it to one or more categories.
Use case: Reduce the prices of selected end-of-line products, while not changing the prices of new products. | Use case: Run a 20% off March Sale on all winter coats. 
A special is stored as a new price, so if you set a special of 10% off a $30 item, the special price goes to $27.  Subsequent changes to the regular price on the [product editing page](/user/products/product_edit/) do not affect the special.  | Sales can be set up as dollars off the regular price, a percent off the regular price, or a specific new price. The first two types of sales (dollars off and percent off) mean the sale price will change if the productâ€™s regular price changes. 
Specials make a single calculation to reduce product price. | Sales may be configured to ignore or be adjusted by the existence of specials on products in categories which are on sale. 

See [Salemaker](/user/admin_pages/catalog/salemaker/) and [Specials](/user/admin_pages/catalog/specials/) for more details  on each of these discounting mechanisms.
