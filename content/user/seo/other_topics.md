## Disabled Product Status for Search Engines
Zen Cart has a configuration setting called [DISABLED_PRODUCTS_TRIGGER_HTTP200](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_stock/#disabled_product_status_for_search_engines).  The default behavior of the product is to not show a product info page for a disabled product; this switch allows the behavior to be changed.  Users who set this value to `true` may require template changes to ensure customers do not actually buy disabled products. See [this page](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/discussions/6165) for more information.

## SEO URLs 

The default installation of Zen Cart does not create "SEO URLs" (URLs that are self-describing).  Some plugins are available to do this:

- [Ultimate SEO URLs](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=132)
- [CEON URI Mapping](https://github.com/JSWebSteve/Ceon-URI-Mapping-V5.1.0)

Please note that the plugin [Simple SEO URLs](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1754) is no longer supported.

## Images and SEO
Image alt text is used by search engines and can improve your SEO.  See [Alt Text](/user/accessibility/concerns/alt_text/) for more details.
