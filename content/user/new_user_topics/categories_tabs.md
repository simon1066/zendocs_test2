The "Category Header Menu" (originally called *Categories-Tabs*), can be switched off by going to [Admin > Configuration > Layout Settings](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_layoutsettings/) and setting *Category Header Menu ON/OFF* (or it might read *Categories-Tabs Menu ON/OFF* ) to zero.
