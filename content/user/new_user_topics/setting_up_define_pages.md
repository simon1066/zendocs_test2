Define Pages are pieces of content that storeowners can easily add to their sites with the built-in HTML Editor in the Zen Cart Admin.

Filling in the define pages allow you to write about: 
- your store's shipping policy
- your store's terms and conditions
- how coupons work in your store

and many other topics. 

More details on define pages are provided in [the template document about Define Pages](/user/template/define_pages/).
