On some pages, to the right of the categories sidebox, the word "Home" (or perhaps "Home > some-category-name") appears above the page content. 

These are called the *breadcrumbs* (think Hansel and Gretel).  They show where you are and how to get back to previous locations. You can either turn them off completely or you can turn them off only on the main page. Although breadcrumbs may look a little odd on your home page, they can very useful to your users as they go deeper into your site.  

To turn them off, go to [Admin > Configuration > Layout settings](/user/admin_pages/configuration/configuration_layoutsettings/) and set *Define Breadcrumb Status* to 0.
