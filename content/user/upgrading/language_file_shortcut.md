If you're doing an upgrade and are worried about all the language file changes you'll have to figure out, rather than porting *all* your customizations, you may want to start small and add customizations as they are needed.  Many older templates made unnecessary changes which you will not want to carry forward.  See [basic language file customizations](/user/localization/basic_158_language_customizations/) for a minimal starting list.
