### What is an Order Status? 

The order status field is a value which encapsulates where the order is in your workflow.
Zen Cart has the following default order statuses: 

- Pending
- Processing
- Delivered 
- Update 

New order statuses can be created in 
[Admin > Localization > Orders Status](/user/admin_pages/localization/orders_status/). 

### How can I set my orders to status Shipped? 

You can add a new order status (Shipped) by going to
[Admin > Localization > Orders Status](/user/admin_pages/localization/orders_status/). 

Then go to [Admin > Customers > Orders](/user/admin_pages/customers/customers/) and update the order's status to 'Shipped' making sure that you set the *Notify Customer* radio button to *Email*.
