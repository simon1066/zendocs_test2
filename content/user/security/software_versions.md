Half the battle of security is simply ensuring your software is up to date. 
Software is versioned so that you can tell at a glance if you are running the current release. 

## Zen Cart version
The [version information for Zen Cart, PHP and MySQL](/user/first_steps/version/) article explains how to get to the [Server/Version Info](/user/admin_pages/tools/server_info/) page. That page will allow you to determine your 
Zen Cart version.

If you are not running the current version, you should start [planning your Zen Cart upgrade](/user/upgrading/). 
An explanation of the importance of upgrading is provided in the article [why should I upgrade?](/user/upgrading/about_upgrading/)

## PHP version
The [version information for Zen Cart, PHP and MySQL](/user/first_steps/version/) article explains how to get to the [Server/Version Info](/user/admin_pages/tools/server_info/) page. That page will allow you to determine your 
PHP version.

[PHP's Version Support Policy](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) will tell you if your PHP version is still supported. Remember: old versions are not PCI compliant, and are not deemed "secure" if they are out of the maintenance period.

You will want to run the latest PHP version which is appropriate for your Zen Cart version.  See  [Server Requirements for running Zen Cart](/user/first_steps/server_requirements/#php-version).

## MySQL version
The [version information for Zen Cart, PHP and MySQL](/user/first_steps/version/) article explains how to get to the [Server/Version Info](/user/admin_pages/tools/server_info/) page. That page will allow you to determine your 
MySQL version.

## JavaScript library versions
JavaScript libraries such as jQuery are updated as issues are found.  It's best to use the most current version of each library you use. 

The easiest way to check if your JavaScript libraries are up to date is to use the [Google Lighthouse](/user/upgrading/javascript_updates/) tool.
