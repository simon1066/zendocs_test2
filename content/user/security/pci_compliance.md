## PABP Standards Compliance

A fresh install of Zen Cart contains several built-in payment modules which connect to an external gateway to do live credit card transaction processing. **These built-in gateway modules are designed to be PABP compliant.**  

Any alterations made to these modules by an individual storeowner, or any addon modules built by third-party developers, may or may not be PABP compliant. The onus is on the store merchant to ensure compliance for satisfying PABP requirements for their own merchant account TOS.
