## I found a bug! 

Like any other software product, Zen Cart does have bugs, and we appreciate 
people taking the time to report them.  The easiest way to report a bug 
is [in the bug reporting sub-forum](https://www.zen-cart.com/forumdisplay.php?140-Bug-Reports) but if you have a Github account, you can also write your finding up as a [Github issue](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/issues).

We take bug reports seriously, and endeavour to find resolutions to them immediately. As you've seen with our releases, we tend to post solutions for bugfixes as soon as we have them. This does not always mean a new "release", unless there is something fairly major. Patches are issued sparingly in the interest of keeping code both manageable and still current.

## Check first! 

The article [known bugs](/user/about_us/known_bugs/) shows significant bugs that have already been reported.  Also remember that if you are not running the most current release, the bug may be fixed by [upgrading your cart](/user/upgrading/). Reviewing the [release notes](/user/about_us/release_history/) between your version and the most current version shows you the fixes that you'll get when you upgrade.

## Security Issues 

If the bug you have found is a security issue, please do not release your finding publicly; instead, follow the [security reporting protocol](/user/about_us/security_reports/).
