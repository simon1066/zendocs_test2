Welcome to Habitat
==================

>NOTE: We are no longer maintaining Habitat, since 2018. You are free to use it, or even use Laravel Homestead if you wish.
We're leaving this documentation up temporarily for your reference in case you are still using Habitat yourself. We will probably remove this section of the docs in 2020.

Habitat is a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)-based virtual machine, with the ability to custom-provision the VM automatically based on settings you decide.

This is great for use on a laptop for portable offline use, or for doing development testing without installing special versions of PHP/MySQL/Apache/etc.

With default settings, it will link a current checkout of the zencart github repository to a domain name that you can access directly from your browser, all from within your own computer. 

A yaml-based configuration system lets you customize your system by adding new shared directories which may map to new websites, and automatically clone other github repositories/branches into those websites.

See the links to the left for detailed instructions for installation and customization.


Habitat was inspired by [Laravel Homestead](http://github.com/laravel/homestead)

You can contribute to this documentation by forking the [zencart/documentation](https://github.com/zencart/documentation) repository on github and submitting Pull Requests.
